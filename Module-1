# Module 1: Introduction to Ethical Hacking
## Video content:
-> CIA: CIA stads for Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. 
=> Cofidentiality is the piller that information is not accessed by unauthorized individuals. It involves using measures like Data encryption, Access control and strong authentication to protect personal and proprietary information. \
=> Integrity is the piller which focuses on maintaining the accuracy and consistency of data throughout its lifecyc;e. It guards against improper modification or destruction of information and ensures authenticity.
=> Availability is the piller ensures that systems and information are accessible and reliable for authorized users when they need them. It involves having systems and backups in place to handle high traffic and prevent downtime. \

## Courseware
/ confidentiality- Confidentiality is the assurance of that the information is accessible only to those authorized to have access. It controls include data classification, data encryption and proper disposal of equipment
/ Intigrity- the trustworthiness of data or resources in therms of preventing improper or unauthorized changes. 
/ Availability- Assurance that the systems responsible for delivering, storing, and processing information are accessible when required by the authorized users. 
/ Authenticity- Refers to the characteristic of a communication, document, or any data that ensures the quality of being genuine.Example-biometrics, smart cards
/ Non-repudiation- A guarantee that the sender of a message cannot later deny having sent the message and that the recipient cannot deny having received the message

/ Tactics, Techniques and Procedures(TTP)
/ Tactics is defined as the strategy adopted by an attacker to perform the attack from the beginning to the end.
/ Techniques is defined as technical methods used by an attacker to achieve intermediate results during the attack.
/ Procedures is defined as a systematic aproach adopt by threat actors to launch an attack
### study types of vulnerability
/ Classification of attacks- passive attack, active attack, close in attack, insider attack, distribution attacks

/ Information Warfare refers to the use of information and communication technologies to gain competitive advantages over an opponent
/ there are two types of information warefare- defensive and offensive
/ Defensive refers to all strategies and actions designed to defend against attacks on ICT assets.
/ Offensive refers to information warfare that involves attacks against the ICT assets of an opponent.
