# Footprinting
. Footprinting is the initial phase of reconnaissance in cybersecurity, where a hacker gathers information about a target's network, systems, and users to find vulnerabilities before launching an attack. \
. Social engineering manipulates people to gain access, while footprinting is a technical or physical information-gathering process to find vulnerabilities. Social engineering exploits human psychology 
through tactics like phishing or scareware to trick victims into revealing information or taking actions that compromise security. Footprinting, on the other hand, involves actively collecting data about a target, 
such as network infrastructure and contact details, through various tools and methods to find potential attack vectors. 




Courseware:
. Learning objectives:

3. footprinting through internet research services and social networking sites
4. perform whois. DNS, network and email footpringting.
5. perform footprinting through social engineering
6. use different footprinting tools
7. apply footprinting best practices

. Reconnaissance (also known as footprinting) refers to the preparatory phase where an attacker seeks to gather as much information as possible about a target of evaluation prior to launching an attack. there are two types of reconnaissance: 1. Passive and 2. Active.
### passive: gathering information about the target without direct interaction which involves -> open source intelligence(OSINT) gathering. -> Proprietary database and paid services and sharing intelligence with partner organizations or industry groups.
### active: gathering information about the target with direct interaction which involves -> DNS interrogation. -> Social Engineering. -> Network/port scanning and user and service enumeration.
