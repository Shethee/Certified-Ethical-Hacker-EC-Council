# Footprinting
. Footprinting is the initial phase of reconnaissance in cybersecurity, where a hacker gathers information about a target's network, systems, and users to find vulnerabilities before launching an attack. \
. Social engineering manipulates people to gain access, while footprinting is a technical or physical information-gathering process to find vulnerabilities. Social engineering exploits human psychology 
through tactics like phishing or scareware to trick victims into revealing information or taking actions that compromise security. Footprinting, on the other hand, involves actively collecting data about a target, 
such as network infrastructure and contact details, through various tools and methods to find potential attack vectors.
